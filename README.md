# AstroImageReconsCNN
Astronomical Image Reconstruction with Convolutional Neural Networks

![imgrecons](imgs/images_rec.png)

This repository contains the code used for the numerical experiments of the foillowing paper:


R. Flamary, "[Astronomical image reconstruction with convolutional neural networks](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1612.04526.pdf)", European Conference on Signal Processing (EUSIPCO), 2017.


The code is under MIT Licence but please refer to and cite the above paper if you use it for academic purposes.

<Note that the code is not yet available due to necessary cleanup but feel free to send me an email if you cannot wait for the GitHub version.>

##  Dependencies

In order to run, the code requires the following Python modules:

* Numpy/Scipy and Matplotlib
* Scikit-image
* Keras and Theano
* Astropy

You can also use the Tensorflow backend in keras but I used the theano backend to save the models provided int his repository.

If you have not already installed them you can install the dependencies with PIP usng the following command

```
$ pip install numpy scipy matplotlib keras theano astropy
```


## Plot results and run simulations

### Reproduce all plots

Numerical experiments results are available in the res directory to reproduce
all  Figures and Table in the paper.

* **visu_images_all.py**: Plot Figure 2 in the paper (show dataset).
* **visu_images_rec.py**: Plot Figure 3 in the paper (reconstruction on M51a).  
* **visu_filters_deconv.py**: Plot Figure 4 in the paper (intermediate CNN filters).
* **visu_comp_perfs.py** : Print Table 1.

### Reproduce all results (numerical computation)

Numerical experiments can be reproduced in 2 steps:
* Learn all the the CNN (saves models in models/).
* Run all reconstruction algorithms (saves results in res/ in matlab format).

To do that you should run the following scripts:

* **run_cnn_all.py** : Run the training for all images with the CNN.
* **run__linearcnn_all.py** : Run the training for all images with the CNN with one linear layer.
* **run_deconv_all.py** : Run the deconvolution for the method given in the first parameter of the command line (from 'none', 'wiener', 'rl', 'vc_tv', 'cnn', 'cnn0').
